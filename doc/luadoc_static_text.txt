* Point
* geometry - When we refer to geometery, we are referring either to a Point object or a table of Point objects, depending on the context. 
For example, if the object is inherently point-like (such as an Item or Projectile), then geometry is a Point.  
For more complex objects (such as a WallItem or a Zone), geometry refers to a Lua table of points.

The Geom class provides a collection of tools to make common transormations to tables of points.  Currently these functions do not work on a single point.
