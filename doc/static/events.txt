/**

@page events Events

Robots and Levelgens can register to be notified of certain game events.
When the event occurs, a special function in the script is called, which
can do anything from add an item to the game (in the case of Levelgens)
to changing destinations (for Robots).  Editor plugins cannot subscribe
to events.
